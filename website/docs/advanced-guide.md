# Advanced Guide

You‚Äôve built your foundation ‚Äî now it‚Äôs time to snap together advanced Lego sets! Here you‚Äôll learn how to automate, scale, and ethically handle OSINT at pro level.

## ü§ñ Automation Pipelines
- **Why automate?**
  - Manual OSINT is slow. Automation lets you cover more ground, faster.
  - Analogy: Like building a Lego conveyor belt that assembles blocks for you.
- **Example: Automated domain footprinting**

```python
import subprocess
import sys
# Run sublist3r to enumerate subdomains
subdomains = subprocess.check_output([sys.executable, '-m', 'sublist3r', '-d', 'example.com'])
print(subdomains.decode())
```
- **Workflow tools**: Use cron jobs, Makefiles, or even GitHub Actions to run scripts on a schedule.

## üï∏Ô∏è Threat Intelligence
- **What is it?**
  - Collecting, analyzing, and sharing info about cyber threats.
- **Lego analogy**: Like building a radar tower to spot incoming threats.
- **Python for threat intel**:
  - Parse threat feeds (STIX, MISP, AlienVault OTX)
  - Correlate indicators (IP, domain, hash)
- **Example: Fetching threat indicators**

```python
import requests
url = 'https://otx.alienvault.com/api/v1/indicators/export'
data = requests.get(url).text
print(data[:500])  # show a sample
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethics & Emerging Tools
- **Ethical OSINT**: Always respect privacy, legality, and intent.
  - Don‚Äôt use OSINT for harassment, doxing, or illegal activity.
  - Analogy: Use your Lego blocks to build, not destroy.
- **Emerging Tools**:
  - Maltego, SpiderFoot, Shodan, Censys, and more.
  - AI and ML for pattern recognition.

## üß† Pro Tips
- Document everything! Use README files, diagrams, and code comments.
- Share your Lego builds (scripts, workflows) with the community.
- Stay up to date: Follow OSINT Twitter, Reddit, and GitHub repos.
- Automate responsibly ‚Äî test scripts on your own assets first.

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Contribute your own automation scripts or threat feeds to the [Showcase](./showcase).
- Suggest improvements or new guides in the [Contributing](./contributing) doc.
- Stay curious, keep building, and help others level up!
