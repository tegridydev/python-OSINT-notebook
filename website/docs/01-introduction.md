# Introduction & Scope

Welcome to the **Python-OSINT-Notebook**, your comprehensive, up-to-date reference for performing **passive** Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) using Python in 2025. Whether you’re a security researcher, threat analyst, journalist, or hobbyist, this guide will help you:

- Discover valuable publicly available data without triggering alerts or violating terms of service  
- Leverage a curated selection of Python libraries, tools, and workflows  
- Automate and schedule repeatable OSINT tasks safely

## Why Passive OSINT?

> **Passive** OSINT means gathering data from **public indices and archives**—certificate transparency logs, DNS history, web caches, search-engine results, and API-provided information—**without** sending direct probes (port scans, active fingerprinting, etc.). This approach minimizes legal and ethical risks while still revealing a wealth of actionable intelligence.

## How This Notebook Is Organized

1. **Core Tools & Libraries**: Deep dives into major frameworks, domain-recon tools, social-media scrapers, and threat-intel platforms.  
2. **Installation & Configuration**: Step-by-step setup on Linux, Windows, macOS, Docker, plus API key and proxy best practices.  
3. **Scripting Examples**: Ready-to-use Python snippets for WHOIS lookups, DNS enumeration, certificate transparency, web metadata, and more.  
4. **Automation & Pipelines**: Cron jobs, GitHub Actions, and Docker Compose recipes for scheduled, unattended data collection.  
5. **Performance & Ethics**: Tips on async concurrency, caching, rate-limiting, and strict adherence to Terms of Service.  
6. **Walkthrough Guides**: End-to-end OSINT101 guide and additional passive-only data sources.  
7. **Resources & Further Reading**: Curated links to communities, datasets, and reference materials.
