# Start Here

Welcome to the **Python OSINT Notebook** a straight forward open-source hub for learning Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) with Python!

## 🧩 How This Site Works
Think of this Notebook as a big box of Lego blocks:
- Each doc is a block you can snap together
- You can build simple things (beginner) or complex structures (advanced)
- If you get stuck, you can always rebuild or swap out blocks

## 🧠 Who Is This For?
- **Absolute beginners**: No Python or OSINT experience? Start here!
- **Intermediate tinkerers**: Ready to build your own tools and scripts.
- **DevChads**: Automation, pipelines, threat intel, and beyond.
- **Neurodivergent learners**: We use simple words, visuals, and analogies.

## 🚦 Choose Your Path
- 🟢 [Beginner Guide](./beginner-guide): What is OSINT? Python basics, safe searching, simple code recipes.
- 🟡 [Intermediate Guide](./intermediate-guide): Tool deep-dives, scripting, real-world workflows, troubleshooting.
- 🔴 [Advanced Guide](./advanced-guide): Automation pipelines, threat intelligence, ethics, pro tips.

## 🛟 If You Get Stuck
- Check the [FAQ](./faq) or [Contributing](./contributing) for help.
- Use the search bar (top right) for instant answers.
- Open an issue or PR on [GitHub](https://github.com/tegridydev/python-OSINT-notebook).

## 🏗️ How to Use This Notebook
- Read docs in any order — build your own learning path
- Copy-paste code snippets and try them out
- Share your own Lego blocks (guides, scripts) with the community
